CHANGES
=======

Version 1.1.0
-------------

Bugs Fixed:

* When deriving from ObjectProxy, if a derived class overrode __new__() and
  tried to access attributes of the ObjectProxy created using the base
  class __new__() before __init__() was called, then an exception would be
  raised indicating that the 'wrapper has not been initialised'.

  Note that this only occurred when the C extension optimisations were
  being used. It did not occur when the pure Python implementation of
  ObjectProxy was being used.

* When deriving from ObjectProxy, if a derived class __init__() attempted
  to update attributes, even the special '_self_' attributed before calling
  the base class __init__() methid, then an exception would be raised
  indicating that the 'wrapper has not been initialised'.

  Note that this only occurred when the C extension optimisations were
  being used. It did not occur when the pure Python implementation of
  ObjectProxy was being used.
